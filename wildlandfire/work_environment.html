                    <H2>What It Like</H2>
                        <p>Wildland firefighters can work 14 days straight (called a roll) with 16-hour days and possibly up to three days travel before and after the official 14. Night shifts and longer shifts of 16-24 hours are possible depending on the fire and area you are in, but not super common. My record is 35 hours straight.</p>
                        <p>Because almost all wildland firefighters need to sleep either in fire camps or in spike camps, they sleep in tents, on the ground, and in hot, smoky, and dusty conditions. Shift work interferes with sleep, especially for those on night shift.</p>
                        <p>You will meet a lot of people and some of them will become good friends maybe even best friends. But sometimes you will find somebody you don’t like. That’s when you’ll learn a life lesson how to work with people you don’t get along with. Because you’re going to be in close quarters with your crew and that depends on what type of crew, you’re on. </p>
                        <p>A lot of the time you will find that you will meet people around the same age and they have the same work ethics as you to. They are willing to get the job done however physically hard it is and willing to help you to accomplish it. A lot of the time they are joking and laughing when they are doing it making the experience of the hard time enjoyable and the best memories that you’re correct. </p>
                        <p>Then there are times when you meet somebody that you cannot stand. Spending 16 a day for 14 days and 6 mouths with that person will make it hard on you. But you just gotta learn how to deal with the job at hand and try to get through your differences.</p>
                        <p>While some wildland firefighters work year-round and some work only during the fire season, the work is always strenuous and positions are always highly competitive. .</p>
