                    <h5>Wildland is a very physical job that takes well disciplined person to maintain their physicality throughout the year. You may think that you will show up to your first day on the job and start your physical training, but that is the wrong idea. </h5>

                    <h5>That’s is because wildland firefighting is a seasonal job and by the you start working in the spring the fire season is starting up. You rely way too much on your physical ability to save your life. You’re expected to carry a minimum of 45 pounds worth of essential equipment and I will talk more about the equipment later on. But that 45-pound backpack that you’re caring is on you 16 hours a day and you’re going up and down steep terrain. </h5>
